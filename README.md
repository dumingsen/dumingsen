### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 Iâ€™m Du Mingsen, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree. I am interested in data mining, artificial intelligence, machine learning, time series analysis (classification, prediction, anomaly detection, generation, imputation), large language models, interpretability, spatio-temporal data analysis, biomedical signal processing, blood pressure estimation, and more.
